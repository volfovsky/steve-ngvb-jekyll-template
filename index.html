<p>I am an assistant professor of statistical science and computer science at Duke University. 
	I work primarily on fundamental properties of different statistical concepts 
	with broad inetrests in network analysis, causal inference and computational constraints of statistical methods. 
	I am the Co-Director two labs at Duke: (1) The <a href="https://www.polarizationlab.com/">Polarization Lab at Duke</a> 
	brings together scholars from the social sciences, statistics, and computer science to develop new technology to bridge Americaâ€™s partisan divide. 
	Check our our newest work on <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/11/20/1906420116">assessing the effects 
	of Russian trolls on political attitudes and behaviors in 2017</a>. 
	(2) The <a href="https://almostmatchingexactly.github.io/">Almost Matching Exactly Lab at Duke</a> brings together statisticians, computer scientists, economists
	and political scientists to develop tools for interpretable causal inference.</p>
	
	<p> I help run the <a href="http://groups.imstat.org/newresearchers/">New Researchers Group</a> at the 
		<a href="http://www.imstat.org/">Institute of Mathematical Statistics</a> which coordinates the 
	Meeting of New Researchers in Statistics and Probability (supported by the 
		National Science Foundation). Plans for our 2021 meeting are coming together so check out the website 
		for new developments (for NRC and the group in general)!</p>
	
	<p> If interested in joining our group to work on exciting problems in statistical methodology for
		political polarization, network analysis and large scale causal inference, please reach out via email 
		with your CV. </p>
	
	<p> Travel is mainly postponed. Depending on how conferences go online you will find me or members of the lab at 
		AISTATS, UAI, JSM, CMSTATS and others.</p>
	
	<p> Our work is graciously supported by NIH, NSF, ARI, Facebook, and Duke University. </p>
